# Automation Login With Selenium

### What is selenium
Selenium is an open-source automated test software used to validate web applications across different browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, microsoft edge and Internet Explorer. It can be used in different programming languages such as python, C#, java, ruby, and javascript to create Selenium test scripts. Testing done using the Selenium testing tool is usually referred to as Selenium Testing.
